          <p>Hello I am Joel Petion from Miami,FL. I am an aspiring Full Stack Developer. Currently, I am attending boot camp for Web Development at the University of Miami.
          <p>I am new to the tech world. It has been a challenging journey start far but loving every minute of it. I love to solve problems and changing my career in social work to tech because I think there is something so awesome about coding. Solving problems, creating apps that can be helpful to the world, yes, sign me up.
          I am a huge sports fan. In my free time, I coach youth football and mentor to the youth in the process. I also LOVE music especially when it is live. I play the drums and a little bit of keyboard piano. One day i hope to start my own coding camp for inner city children. Its going to happen(self promise). </p>
